  <Title>Open Siddur Project Transform Documentation</Title>
  <Introduction>
    <div>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the XSLT transform documentation.  This website documents the 
    code used in:
    <ul>
      <li>transformations from JLPTEI to XHTML</li>
      <li>one-time transformations from other formats to JLPTEI</li>
    </ul>
    The documentation is automatically generated from specialized elements in the 
    source code, which is available at 
    <a href="http://jewishliturgy.googlecode.com">our Google code subversion 
    repository</a>.  Documentation generation is performed using a modified 
    version of <a href="http://xsltdoc.sf.net/">XSLTDoc</a>.
    </p>

      <h2>Code organization</h2>
      <p>The main entry point to the transformation is stage1.xsl2, which 
      includes the files that do the processing.  In general, each XSLT stylesheet
      performs one part of the processing.  The default mode is used exclusively to
      convert TEI to XHTML.  The XHTML target is particularly simple, consisting
      only of a minimal HTML header and all content wrapped in html:div elements.
      This form of XHTML is referred to in the documentation as 
      &ldquo;muXHTML,&rdquo; for &ldquo;micro XHTML.&rdquo;  
      It is intended to be styled by CSS for rendering, or converted to other
      formats using additional stylesheets.
      </p>
      <p>Intermediate processing is performed in non-default modes.
      Some of the more complex parts of the processing are the conversions of
      multiple concurrent hierarchies into a single combined hierarchy 
      (concurrent.xsl2) and the processing of conditional inclusion instructions
      (conditionals.xsl2).</p>
      <p>Some code is automatically generated.  This includes:
      <ul>
        <li>the XPointer 
      parsing code, which is generated by grammar.xsl2 from a grammatical description
       of the specification in grammar.xml.</li>
        <li>the transforms of the most basic elements from JLPTEI to XHTML, all
        of which use generic templates generated by muxhtml-generator.xsl2</li>
       </ul></p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Free software</h2>
